      <h6>Biography</h6>
      <p>Faulkner, who won the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1949 among other major awards, 
      came to the University in 1957 and 1958 for two terms as its first writer-in-residence 
      and remains a prominent literary figure here. UVA’s Albert and Shirley Small Special 
      Collections Library holds a large repository of his papers and documentation of his 
      time on Grounds.</p>

      <p>Faulkner returned as writer-in-residence in the spring of 1958. The following year, 
      he worked from a study in Alderman Library as a consultant on contemporary literature 
      to the library. He was appointed lecturer in American literature in 1960 and divided 
      his time between Charlottesville and Oxford, Miss., until his death in 1962.</p>
      <p>To mark the 50th anniversary of Faulkner’s second term as writer-in-residence, 
      the Special Collections Library hosted an April 4 symposium, “Faulkner in the University: 
      Then and Now.” An accompanying exhibit—which includes an interactive kiosk featuring video 
      and audio, along with letters, manuscripts, Faulkner’s typewriter and tweed jacket—can 
      be seen through Aug</p>
