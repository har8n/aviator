      <h1>Faulkner: Life and Works</h1>
      <p class="caption">An exhibition on the life and works of William Faulkner</p>
      <h6>The Exhibition</h6>
      <p>Surveying one of the great archives of American literature – the William Faulkner 
      collections at the University of Virginia – this exhibition includes manuscripts 
      alongside first editions and key archival documents.  The novelist’s life is narrated 
      through the personae he inhabited: artist, aviator, screenwriter, Nobel prizewinner, 
      white southerner, and UVA writer-in-residence, and more. Die-hard fans, the general 
      public, and even the Faulkner-phobic will find the unexpected.</p>

      <h6>Biography</h6>
      <p>William Faulkner, who won the 1949 Nobel Prize for Literature, came to Charlottesville

      papers, as well as dozens of related collections that document Faulkner's works and life,
