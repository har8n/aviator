      <h6>The Exhibition</h6>
      <p>Surveying one of the great archives of American literature – the William Faulkner 
      collections at the University of Virginia – this exhihibition includes manuscripts 
      alongside first editions and key archival documents.  The novelist’s life is narrated 
      through the personae he inhabited: artist, aviator, screenwriter, Nobel prizewinner, 
      white southerner, and UVA writer-in-residence, and more. Die-hard fans, the general 
      public, and even the Faulkner-phobic will find the unexpected.</p>
